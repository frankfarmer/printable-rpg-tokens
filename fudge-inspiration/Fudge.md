# OldSchoolDM’s Fudge Token Rules for D&D 5e
## A House Rule for 5e-compatible Dungeons and Dragons

The goal of this system is to allow for official die-roll fudging - modifying the results after the dice are rolled. Provides a token-constrained method for every player (including the DM) to openly change the fate (force a hit/success or miss/fail) of any roll.

### History



I’ve been using this system (in various forms) since D&D 4e. It’s a lot of fun and takes the stigma out of the “fudging is cheating” controversy by making it available to every player who really-really wants a little more control over their [monster’s] effectiveness. These rules are hereby released to the Public Domain. Take, use, modify to your heart’s content!

## Fudge Tokens TLDR;
 * Primary mechanics
  * Fudge Tokens are worth +1/-1 on any roll and acts as a modifier (it does not change the value on the face of the die.)
  * On a roll with an undesired result, if the result could be changed with no more than 3 tokens spent, the DM will announce the result and ask-for/announce any token(s) to be spent.
   * Anyone can contribute to a token pool (up to the maximum 3 tokens total) to spend to modify a roll.
   * Player-spent tokens are given to the DM or DM-spent tokens are discarded from play. 
  * Really, any roll - Fudge Tokens may be spent to increase or decrease any roll, including damage rolls, gambling results, etc. For example, reducing a Dragon’s Breath Weapon Attack by 1 or 2 hit points might keep a character conscious…
  * Fudge Tokens are always effective - The results of spends are known in advance of spending and can not be cancelled.
 * Distributing Tokens
  * Setup - At the start of each session, each player is given 3 fudge tokens and the DM starts with 1 fudge token per player at the table.
   * Optional - DM may choose to reward a token for between game activities, such as session notes/reporting, cleanup assistance, uploading photos, etc. This would allow a temporary exception to the maximum below.
  * Maximum Tokens Held - No player may hold more than 3 tokens at a time, the DM may not hold more than the number of players. Any extras are discarded from play. 
  * All tokens are returned to the DM at the end of the session - they do not accumulate between sessions. Use them or lose them.
  * Bad Luck = Fudge Token - If a player/DM rolls a natural one and does NOT choose modify the roll in any way (Fudge Tokens, Inspiration Point spend) they receive a Fudge Token a consolation prize (but only if they are not at their current limit.)
  * Optional replenishment - Other than just the single initial grant of tokens for an entire session, fully replenishing Fudge Tokens at other milestones might be fun for your group: Consider, whenever the party “levels”, meets a plot milestone (my favorite), or even begins an adventuring day.

## Full description & clarifications:

### Mechanics
What is a Fudge Token? It is a physical object representing the ability to modify any die roll by adding or subtracting 1 (one) to the final result. You can use just about anything as a token. (Here is an STL file to print your own Fudge Tokens (which also includes an Inspiration token model.)

Using a Fudge Token: After a roll is made by anyone at the table, the DM makes any determination and announces any effects, success, or failure, as normal. But, if the result could be changed by adjusting the result by up to 3 (either + or -) the DM will declare the number of fudge tokens required to modify the result. The table is given a moment to decide if currently any held tokens (up to 3 maximum total) are worth spending to change the outcome.

These tokens can come from any player, and often come from players other than the person that made the roll (or is subject to the roll as a defender.) This is a key feature, as it encourages the entire table to pay attention to critical events during other player’s turns.

Again, Fudge Tokens can be used on any die roll and are often used to adjust damage rolls up or down to kill or save a monster or character.

The process of a player spending a fudge token is to hand it to the DM, who adds it to their pool to be spent on monsters/challenges later. When a DM spends a token it is removed from the play area until replenished by a player spend or the reset conditions are met (see below.)

All Spends are Effective: The token spend only happens if there is enough to change the result. This is spending a scarce resource to modify the results. 

No Cancellation: Once the first Fudge Token is offered on a roll, the polarity (plus or minus) of the result modification is “locked.” For example: If the DM says “I missed my Legendary Attack by one, I’m spending a Fudge Token to make it a hit (a plus +1)” no player may try to cancel the modification by playing a negative fudge token. Everyone that has the resources to fudge a result gets the result they pay for. 

## Gaining tokens
### Starting Tokens
At the start of each session, each player starts with 3 Fudge Tokens which are not transferable but may be spent on any roll. The DM starts with one token for each player at the table.

### Bad Luck
A token will be granted for any player-rolled natural 1 for saving throws/attacks/skill checks when an ally or the character is under direct threat of harm AND the roll is accepted for the resolution of the roll. It may not be modified or replaced in any way and still receive the token.

### OldSchoolDM’s special bonuses:
I grant bonus starting tokens for people who help out between sessions. These bonuses may temporarily be granted in excess of the 3-token held limit. I really want to encourage table-help, and it works wonders for me - especially for mid-session terrain resets…

 * Uploading Photos - If you take photos at the session and upload them before noon on the Saturday following the session, you will receive 2 tokens at the start of the next session you attend. If you upload them after Saturday noon, you will still receive 1 token at the next session.
 * Cleanup/Setup/Help the DM - If you stay after the session to help put away my stuff, you will be granted a token at the next session.
If the DM requests help before (setup) or during the session, tokens will be granted immediately for use during that session.
 * Write between session reports (character downtime reports, adventure summaries, etc.) - These are always welcome. Complete session summaries written before noon Saturday are worth 2 tokens [It makes posting the summary at oldschooldm.com much easier.]

### Replenishment options
I’ve been very happy with the pressure that a single initial token grant puts on my players to spend them as they go. If the session is very long (greater than 4 hours), I like to do a refresh at any major plot milestone after we break for supper. Often there will be a terrain breakdown/rebuild and photos uploaded during the break for my optional gains above.) You may consider more often - adventuring day, or level-up - depending on how much you want to encourage roll modification.
